Description: Supervised machine learning often comprises a large part of bioinformatic
    studies. However, the sheer complexity of classification pipelines poses a significant
    barrier to expert scientists otherwise unspecialized in machine learning. Moreover,
    many biologists lack the time or technical skills necessary to implement these methods
    properly. The exprso package introduces a framework for the rapid implementation of
    high-throughput supervised machine learning built with the biologist user in mind.
    Written by biologists, for biologists, exprso provides a user-friendly R interface
    that empowers investigators to execute state-of-the-art classification with minimal
    programming experience.
